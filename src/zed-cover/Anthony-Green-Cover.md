Hi Mary, it was great to meet you and the team at RustConf, and I appreciate
that you're taking the time to consider my application. 

##### Why Zed?

Since getting hands-on with Zed and submitting my resume, I've been giving some
thought to how Zed Industries as an employer aligns with my interests and
goals. Zed presents an opportunity to improve the ease and efficiency of
software development. It's a force multiplier for the industry, one that I can
leverage to have a big impact. As someone who's spent quite a bit of time
learning and customizing his editor, optimizing developer workflow has become a
passion of mine. 

Reading the team page, I was struck by the caliber of developers at Zed and the
influential projects they’ve built. The opportunity to contribute alongside and
learn from such a group would be both inspiring and transformative for my
growth as an engineer.

##### How am I prepared to contribute?  

I've been a programmer for 6 years, and I bring over 4 years of experience with
Rust and GPU programming. I committed over a year to my largest Rust project,
which was a physics engine commissioned by two of my professors for simulation
research. I designed and implemented the project from scratch, and gained
experience building all parts of a desktop application. This includes UI, input
handling, file management, data import/export/visualization, scripting, and
CI/CD tooling. With all rendering and compute implemented using WebGPU and
optimized for performance, the project taught me a lot about creating efficient
GPU pipelines — experience I’d be thrilled to bring to editor development at
Zed. 

In my current role, I already work remotely across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
My team follows a similar model of collaboration, using issues, pull requests,
and reviews to facilitate communication and contribution.  

I have the context and skills to quickly make contributions to the project
across all platforms, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with the team to
push Zed forward.

Sincerely,\
**Anthony Green**
