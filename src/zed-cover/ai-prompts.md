### Motivation: Why are you interested in working with Zed specifically?

I've spent quite a bit of time going down the Neovim configuration rabbit hole,
optimizing developer workflow has become a passion of mine. Combined with more
than 2 years of experience with Rust and GPU programming, I have the context and
skills to quickly make contributions to the project. 

### Trajectory: Since this is a contracting-to-hire setup, how does this fit into your career goals?

I'm not particularly concerned about the contracting detail, money is money,
and this can turn into a real position. However, the project itself aligns with
my career goals in the sense that it's an opportunity to make an impact on the
world. I've learned from game dev that making things that are pointless or a
net negative (like games) leave me unfulfilled and ashamed of myself. This
project is an opportunity to improve the ease and efficiency of software
development, which is a force multiplier for the industry. It's important to
mean that I make software with utility, that has a positive impact on the world.
Facilitating a productive and enjoyable software development experience is
something that I find particularly engaging and rewarding, as it's something
I've enjoyed creating for myself and would love to help create for others.

### Learning mindset: We know you’re not a senior yet — how do you approach learning new systems or unfamiliar parts of a codebase?

Asking questions and reading docs are good ways to get global
context/understanding, after that, it's a lot of reading code, the best way to
understand the details is to observe them directly. Tweaking things/learning by
doing is also a key to the approach. 

### Contribution style: This role starts with open-source contributions. How comfortable are you with async collaboration (issues, PRs, code review) and receiving feedback publicly?

Extremely, my current job is remote, we use a very similar workflow, I've also
contributed to open source projects in the past, the most recent of which was a
Neovim plugin (editor tech, serendipitous).

## Engineer Perspective (technical and team fit)

### Rust practice: Tell me about the Rust projects you’ve built so far — what parts were you most proud of, and what challenges did you hit?

My biggest Rust project is one I worked on for over a year under a couple of
professors from University. It was an engine for particle-based physics
simulations, which used WebGPU for all rendering and compute(even event
handling). I implemented that project from scratch, and gained experience
building all parts of a desktop application. This includes UI, file handling,
data import and export, GPU rendering and compute, integrated scripting,
continuous integration, and extensive optimization.

### Problem-solving: If you hit an issue in the Zed codebase that you don’t understand, what’s your process for unblocking yourself before asking for help?

I would either start by searching the code base and documentation. If that
didn't work I would check with an LLM. If I was truly stuck then I would ask a
team member, but I'm used to having no choice but to figure things out myself,
so I tend to be self-managing.

### Code review readiness: Imagine we comment on your PR suggesting a different design approach. How do you respond?

I'd confirm that I understand the direction, if it makes sense then I go
implement. If I don't agree I may try to resolve the disagreement, but it
depends on how important the particular design is. There are many cases where
things work either way and it's not worth arguing about. When determining
whether something makes sense to me or if it's worth arguing about, I would try
to keep the end user, cost/benefit, and project vision in mind. We are all
engineers, so I would expect that we are like minded and won't have major
disagreements.

This kinda makes me sound like a problem... 

### High-potential signal: What’s an example of a time you ramped up quickly on something unfamiliar and delivered value fast?

The first thing that comes to mind is my most recent open source contribution,
which was to a Neovim plugin. I had never worked on something like that before,
in fact I barely knew the language, but I implemented a complex new feature
over only 2 or 3 days. I suppose the start of any of my projects would be good
examples. Each one I start is something I haven't done before, but I always
figure it out. Experience has taught me that I have no reason to hesitate or
doubt my ability when it comes to working on unfamiliar things. 

### Some other things possibly worth mentioning.

They have some .nix files in their project, I'm on NixOS so I'm familiar with
that tech. They use markdown a lot, I'm writing this cover in markdown as a
nod. I have a degree? They know that, it's on my resume. I guess it was just
the nix thing that came to mind. Oh, I run Linux, which they seem to feel they
were lacking support for, but I also have a Mac and Windows machine, so I'm setup
to immediately contribute to development on all platforms.
