# Cover Letter – Open Source Developer (Contract-to-Hire)  Anthony Green  

---

## Introduction  

I’m excited to apply for the Open Source Developer (contract-to-hire) position
at Zed. For the past few years, I’ve been deeply focused on developer workflow
— both in my own practice and in my projects. What began with exploring and
extending Neovim has grown into a passion for building tools that make software
development faster, more enjoyable, and more productive.  

Zed’s mission aligns perfectly with this passion: creating an editor that
pushes the boundaries of speed, collaboration, and usability. I’m eager to
bring my Rust and systems programming experience to help make Zed the best
place for developers to work.

## Why Zed  

My career goal is to work on software that meaningfully improves people’s
ability to create. Through my time in game development, I learned that I’m most
fulfilled when building tools with utility and positive impact — not just
entertainment.  

Working on Zed represents a chance to multiply the productivity of thousands of
developers. That kind of leverage is exactly where I want to invest my skills
and energy.

## Technical Experience  

- **Rust & Systems Programming**  I’ve spent over two years developing in Rust,
including a year-long research project under university professors where I
built a particle-based physics simulation engine from scratch.  
  - Used **WebGPU** for rendering and compute (including event handling).  
  - Implemented UI, file handling, data import/export, scripting integration,
  CI pipelines, and heavy optimization.  
  - This gave me end-to-end experience building complex desktop applications —
  the kind of depth directly relevant to Zed.  

- **Open Source Contributions**  Most recently, I contributed a feature to a
Neovim plugin. Even with little prior experience in lua, I was able
to learn quickly and ship a working feature in just a few days. This
demonstrated my ability to ramp up fast, work in a codebase I didn’t know, and
collaborate asynchronously.  

- **Ecosystem Alignment**  I work primarily on **NixOS**, and I noticed Zed has
`.nix` files in its repo. I’m comfortable with reproducible builds and Nix
workflows. I also develop across **Linux, macOS, and Windows**, so I’m ready
to help test and contribute cross-platform from day one.

## How I Work  

- **Learning** → I start by reading documentation and code, then explore by
tweaking and experimenting directly. This mix of research and hands-on practice
helps me learn quickly and retain context.  
- **Problem-Solving** → I rely on code search, docs, and modern tools (LLMs,
local testing) before escalating. When I do ask for help, it’s after I’ve
gathered concrete details.  
- **Collaboration** → My current role is fully remote, using PRs, reviews, and
async communication daily. I’m comfortable with transparent, public feedback,
and I view code review as a collaborative step toward better design.

## Closing  

I’m enthusiastic about the chance to contribute to Zed’s mission. I bring
hands-on Rust experience, a proven ability to learn fast, and a deep personal
motivation to improve developer workflows.  

Thank you for your consideration — I look forward to the opportunity to
contribute to Zed’s future.  

Best,  Anthony Green
