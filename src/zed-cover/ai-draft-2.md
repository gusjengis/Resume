# Cover Letter – Open Source Developer (Contract-to-Hire)  Anthony Green  

---

## Introduction  

I’m excited to apply for the Open Source Developer position at Zed.  Developer
workflow has become a passion of mine — what started with configuring and
extending Neovim has grown into building tools that improve speed and usability
for myself and others. Zed’s mission to push the boundaries of editor
performance and collaboration directly aligns with the kind of work I want to
dedicate myself to.

## Relevant Experience  

- **Rust & Systems Programming**  Over two years of experience, including a
year-long research project where I built a particle-based physics simulation
engine in Rust. This project involved GPU compute and rendering via WebGPU, as
well as UI, file handling, scripting integration, and optimization.  

- **Ecosystem Alignment**  I develop on NixOS, macOS, and Windows, and noticed
Zed already uses `.nix` files in its repo. I can contribute and test across all
platforms from day one.

## Closing  

Zed represents the kind of impactful project I want to work on: software that
multiplies developer productivity and creativity. I’d be excited to bring my
Rust background, OSS contributions, and passion for developer tools to the
team.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best,  Anhony Green
